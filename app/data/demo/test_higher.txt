*******HIGHER AND HIGHER (C)

This is a kind of messy chart, with
inconsistent formatting and a few key
changes. I am sprinkling in some "bad"
chords as well (mixture of chords that
aren't in the key, chords with unusual
permutations, and typos), eventually the
app will sniff these out as suspicious and
throw a warning or auto-fix, depending.

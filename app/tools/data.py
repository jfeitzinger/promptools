i think songs will be stored as 2 tables each,
one for the contents (columns for the parts of the tuple),
and one for the song metadata. the metadata table will have a column that indicates the name of the song table.

still need to learn how sqlite dbs are sturctured, but i think it will be like... each song COLLECTION is a table.
the table contains columns for all the song metadata, and a column that points to the name of the table with the song tktuple data.
above the level of the COLLECTION will be another table that defines the different collections in each part of the program (setlist, pool)
and pointers for those respective tables.
another level higher we can point to the tables for GIG metadata alongside the COLLECTIONS. hopefully this
makes sense with the way SQL works. will research tomorrow.
